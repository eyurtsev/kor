Welcome to Kor's documentation!
===============================

This is a half-baked prototype that "helps" you extract structured data from text using LLMs ðŸ§©.

Specify the schema of what should be extracted and provide some examples.

Kor will generate a prompt, send it to the specified LLM and parse out the
output. You might even get results back.
