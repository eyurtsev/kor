    "The quality of the results depends on a lot of factors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few things to experiment with to improve quality:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Add more examples. Diverse examples can help, including examples where nothing should be extracted.\n",
    "* Improve the descriptions of the attributes.\n",
    "* If working with multi-paragraph text, specify an `input_formatter` of `\"triple_quotes\"` when creating the chain.\n",
    "* Try a better model (e.g., text-davinci-003, gpt-4).\n",
    "* Break the schema into a few smaller schemas, run separate extractions, and merge the results.\n",
    "* If possible to flatten the schema, and use a CSV encoding instead of a JSON encoding.\n",
    "* Add verification/correction steps (ask an LLM to correct or verify the results of the extraction).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Keep in mind! üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you're extracting information from a **single** **structured** source (e.g., linkedin), using an LLM is not a good idea -- traditional web-scraping will be much cheaper and reliable.\n",
    "* If perfect quality is needed, then even with all the hacks above, you'll need to plan on having a human in the loop as even the best LLMs will make mistakes with complex extraction tasks."
