# Contributing to Kor

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Kor!

At the moment, I'm only gauging interest from the community in this package.

It's possible that the approach taken here is simply wrong, in which case
further development doesn't make sense.

If you find this package useful for your use-cases, let me know. Feel free to
create issues with ideas.

If you submit PRs with new features, I will probably not merge in into the code
as the internal code is not stable yet, but I will try to massage them into the
package at some point.
